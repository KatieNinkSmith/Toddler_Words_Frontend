### Toddler Words Learning Application

# Overview

The Toddler Words Learning Application is a web-based platform designed to help toddlers learn basic words across several categories. Inspired by my daughterâ€™s eagerness to learn, this app features real-life images and audio for words in four key categories: Colors, Animals, Food, and Counting. The goal is to make learning fun and accessible, while providing parents with a tool to help their children start recognizing and pronouncing words.

**Frontend (Deployed):** Toddler Words Frontend
**Backend (Deployed):** Toddler Words Backend

**Backend GitHub Repo:** Toddler Words Backend GitHub

# Features

### Main Categories:

**Colors:** Includes basic rainbow colors, though orange does not have an audio file available.
**Animals:** A variety of animals from around the world.
**Food:** A selection of foods toddlers might encounter in early life.
**Counting:** Numbers from 1 to 10.

### User-Added Categories: Users can add new words, images, and audio files under the following custom categories:

**Family**
**Places**
**Clothing**
**Things**
(Note: The functionality to save files correctly is still under development.)

# Functionality

**Interactive Learning:** Users can click on a category to be taken to a page displaying:

The word written out.
A corresponding image or color.
A button to play the audio for the word (default audio is pulled from the API: Dictionary API).
Customization: Users can add their own words, images, and audio to enrich the learning experience, though the feature is currently being debugged for proper file-saving functionality.

# Future Plans

**Alphabet:** Plans to include the alphabet with audio, though the file-saving issue must be resolved first.
**Bug Fixes:** Work is underway to correct the file-saving function for uploaded audio files.

# Inspiration

This project was inspired by my daughter, who is eager to learn and engage with new words. I couldn't find a resource that met her needs, so I built this app to provide her with an interactive and child-friendly learning experience.
